Espace
======

Espace is an open-source arcade shooting space game written in Python with Ergame and Pygame.
Ergame is my personal game library, and it's available [here on github](https://github.com/EricsonWillians/Ergame).

### Controls:

AWSD or ARROWS for movement.
LSHIFT for boost.
SPACE for shooting.
P for pause.

Gameplay hint: You can move faster by combining the movements of AWSD and the ARROWS (And LSHIFT).
