Espace
======

Espace is an open-source arcade shooting space game written in Python 2.7 with Ergame and Pygame.
Ergame is my personal game library, and it's available [here on github](https://github.com/EricsonWillians/Ergame).

### Controls:

* AWSD or ARROWS for movement.
* LSHIFT for boost.
* SPACE for shooting.
* P for pause.

### Latest Updates:

* Advanced bullet control.
* Player health.
* Improved health system (Now each Health Bar has a visual numberic representation of its value).
* Enemy bullets (Now they shoot as well).

### Gameplay Hints:

* You can move faster by combining the movements of AWSD and the ARROWS (And LSHIFT).
* Advanced bullet control: Now the player has a feature that requires a bit of skill. If you combine movements and at the same time shoot, you'll be able to control your bullets (And that allows you to cluster bullets in order to wipe out more enemies).
