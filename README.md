Espace
======

Espace is an open-source arcade shooting space game written in Python 2.7 with Ergame and Pygame.
Ergame is my personal game library, and it's available [here on github](https://github.com/EricsonWillians/Ergame).

### Controls:

* AWSD or ARROWS for movement.
* LSHIFT for boost.
* SPACE for shooting.
* P for pause.

### Latest Updates:

* Advanced bullet control.
* Player health.
* Improved health system (Now each Health Bar has a visual numberic representation of its value).
* Enemy bullets (Now they shoot as well).

### Gameplay Hints:

* You can move faster by combining the movements of AWSD and the ARROWS (And LSHIFT).
* If you combine movements at the same time that you shoot, you'll be able to control your bullets (And that allows you to cluster bullets in order to wipe out more enemies).
* You can shoot backwards or do side-shooting if you combine the movements and shoot, but release the SPACE bar first.
